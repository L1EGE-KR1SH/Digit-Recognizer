# Digit-Recognizer
A complete digit recognition AI developed using no machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch or scikit-learn. In this project, there is simply a raw implementation of a neural network in Python (forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight update), applied to classify, the handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset.
